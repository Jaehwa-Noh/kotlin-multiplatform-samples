## Multiplatform Jetpack Libraries 
This project integrates several Jetpack libraries that are KMP compatible:

- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/multiplatform/room)
- [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/multiplatform/datastore)

## Running The app

We recommend installing the [Kotlin Multiplatform Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform) to Android Studio.
This plugin offers several features to ease the development experience:

-   **New project wizard**: Create a new multiplatform project within the IDE.
-   **Preflight checks**: Preflight checks help you configure your environment.
-   **Run configurations**: Run, debug, and test applications on both iOS and
    Android directly from the IDE.
-   **Basic Swift support in the IDE**: Get basic Swift support in the IDE,
    including cross-language debugging tools, navigation and quick
    documentation.
